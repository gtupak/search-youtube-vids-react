# Youtube search and show
#### My first react website

This repository was simply to teach myself React. You can see a screenshot of it below.

You can search up terms querried agains the Youtube Data API and display them on the page. You can click on a video and play it, similar to how Youtube does it.

If you want to try it, you'll have to replace the API key of the Youtube API with your own, from the [google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com)
